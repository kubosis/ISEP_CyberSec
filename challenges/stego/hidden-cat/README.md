# Hidden Cat Flag
Category: stego  
Difficulty: Easy

This is a regular cat image, but something is hidden inside. Try simple commands like `strings` or examine the end of the file.

Hint:
- The flag isn’t in the visible image; it’s hiding somewhere in the file.
- Sometimes important info is appended after the image data.
- Look at the end of the file with a tool that shows raw bytes.
